# **Money, Sleep, and Love: The Effects of Income and Sleeping Arrangements on Relationships**

  This is a project for Math for Data Science course at Fordham GSAS by @RabiaGondur, @jkevfernandez, and @nicholastwai. In this project, we explored three datasets to investigate the effects of money, sleep and love on relatioship length/status. We used the python packages pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to analyze and visualize the data. After our data analysis, we wrote a
[**paper**](https://github.com/RabiaGondur/MoneySleepLove/blob/main/Project%20Report.pdf) to summarize our findings and address the limitations.
